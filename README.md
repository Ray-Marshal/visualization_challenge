# Visualization_Challenge

## Data Analytics Certificate Bootcamp: University of Oregon

In this project I am using Pandas to analyze and visualize data concerning pharmaceutical tests on mice. I clean the data, gather summary statistics and visualize the data using bar charts, pie charts, line graphs and a scatter plot, which includes a regression line. This was completed as an assignment for the University of Oregon Data Analytics Bootcamp.
